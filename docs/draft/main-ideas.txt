How would you want to write in shell script like this:
	<insert the very easy hello world example here>

Yes, that's very possible with SHCF. You need not have to worry where that function is located, just make it work.

------

** A framework that:
 * won't interfere with my local shell environment
 * will guide me BUT minimally impose how to do it (e.g. you need not define the COMMAND paths for the script to be fully flexible)
 * is a quick framewok to port existing code into
 * usable in learning a huge shell scripting codebase
 * let you focus writing the function instead of getting distracted having to scroll over a very very long line of code

** Coding in shell is quite straightforward. But mind you, when you get into huge projects fully written in shell, you get to see horrors (duplicate function calls, functions calling global variables, etc)

** Insert why this was called an SHSDK since it can create using it's own scaffolding tool shcf_cli.
